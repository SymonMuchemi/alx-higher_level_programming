# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

This repository contains code expressing my understanding on the following topics:

    - mutable vs immutable objects
    - references
    - assignment
    - identical variables
    - variables linked to the same object
    - displaying a variable's identifier
    - how python passes variables to functions
