# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

In this repository, there contains code that expresses my understanding on the following topics related to classes in Python:

    - objects and instances
    - attributes
    - `self`
    - methods
    - the `__init__` method
    - data abstraction, data encapsulation and information hiding
    - properties
    - properties vs attributes
    - writing getters and setters
    - using the `getattr` function
    - creating abittrary attributes
