# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm Up

## Why JavaScript programming is amazing

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It's also the language of the web, making it essential for web development.

## How to run a JavaScript script

You can run a JavaScript script by including it in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag or by using a JavaScript runtime like Node.js with the command `node script.js`.

## How to create variables and constants

In JavaScript, you can create variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. For example, `let variableName = value;` or `const constantName = value;`.

## Differences between var, const and let

`var` is function scoped and can be redeclared. `let` and `const` are block scoped. `let` can be reassigned, but `const` cannot.

## Data types in JavaScript

JavaScript has several data types: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Null`, `Undefined`, and `Symbol`.

## Using if, if ... else statements

`if` statements are used for conditional execution of code. `if ... else` statements provide an alternative execution path when the `if` condition is not met.

## How to use comments

In JavaScript, you can create comments with `//` for single line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

## Affecting values to variables

You can assign a value to a variable with the `=` operator. For example, `let variableName = value;`.

## Using while and for loops

`while` and `for` loops are used for repeated execution of code. `while` loops continue until a condition is no longer met, and `for` loops execute a set number of times.

## Using break and continue statements

`break` is used to exit a loop prematurely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

## What is a function and how to use functions

A function is a reusable block of code. You can define a function with the `function` keyword and call it using its name followed by parentheses `()`.

## What does a function that does not use any return statement return

A function that does not use a return statement returns `undefined`.

## Scope of variables

The scope of a variable refers to where it can be accessed. Variables declared with `var` are function scoped, while those declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.

## Arithmetic operators in JavaScript

JavaScript has several arithmetic operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus), `++` (increment), and `--` (decrement).

## How to manipulate dictionary

In JavaScript, dictionaries are known as objects. You can manipulate them by accessing or assigning values with dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object["property"]`).

## How to import a file

You can import a file in JavaScript using the `import` keyword, like so: `import moduleName from './path/to/module';`.
